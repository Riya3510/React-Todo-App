# To-Do App

This is a simple To-Do app built using **React.js**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It allows users to add, update, delete, and prioritize tasks. The app also supports saving tasks to **local storage**, so even after refreshing the page, the tasks remain as they were.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can input tasks and add them to the list.
- **Update Tasks**: Users can edit existing tasks and update their names and priorities.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete individual tasks.
- **Remove All**: Users can remove all tasks with a single click.
- **Priority Feature**: Users can set a priority (High, Medium, or Low) for each task. High priority tasks are displayed at the top of the list, followed by Medium and Low priority tasks.
- **Persistence**: Tasks are saved to **local storage**, so they persist even after refreshing the page.
  
## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For building the user interface and managing state.
- **HTML**: For structuring the application.
- **CSS**: For styling the components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling.
